**NOTE**: see exercise & set-up guide me /documents

### has 2 exercises before start working:
  1. clean code microservice using fastAPI (DDD demo, I'll do more practice on design pattern on another repo and inside real work from summer intern that I can't share)
  2. Azure DevOps - cicd -> build image into gcp artifact registry, deploy into cloud run service (using terraform config and monitoring log after sending request to FastAPI specific endpoints)

**P.S.** This exercise ended just for me to learn ideal cicd and some hands-on try by myself to be able to work with seniors after got an assignment on first job (I got to be in the design pattern team that designs the single practice that all DS team gonna follow while writing the code)
