**NOTE**: see exercise & set-up guide me /documents

### has 2 exercises before start working:
  1. clean code microservice using fastAPI (DDD demo, I'll do more practice on design pattern on another repo and inside real work from summer intern that I can't share)
  2. Azure DevOps - cicd -> build image into gcp artifact registry, deploy into cloud run service (using terraform config and monitoring log after sending request to FastAPI specific endpoints)

**P.S.** This exercise ended just for me to learn ideal cicd and some hands-on try by myself to be able to work with seniors after got an assignment on first job (I got to be in the design pattern team that designs the single practice that all DS team gonna follow while writing the code)

1. **Clean Code Principles (SOLID, OOP, DDD, TDD)**:
   - **SOLID Principles**: Ensure your code is modular, maintainable, and scalable.
   - **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Helps in organizing code into reusable objects.
   - **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**: Focus on modeling the domain (real-world context) into the software structure.
   - **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Write tests before code to ensure functionality meets requirements.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**:
   - **Testing**: Automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
   - **Building**: Compile and package code.
   - **Deployment**: Automatically deploy code to a staging or production environment.

For your task, converting a Jupyter notebook into a Python script project using DI and creating an adapter for multiple DI involves these steps:

1. **Refactor the Notebook Code**: Convert Jupyter notebook cells into Python functions and classes following OOP and DDD principles.
2. **Implement Dependency Injection (DI)**: Use DI to manage dependencies, making the code more modular and testable.
3. **Create Adapters for Multiple DI**: Implement different DI frameworks (e.g., Dependency Injector, built-in Python DI) and use an adapter pattern to switch between them.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deploying the project.
