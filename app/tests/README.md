## Running Tests
Run your tests using the pytest command:

```bash
pytest
```

Conclusion
This setup ensures that your server is initialized correctly, and your application's components are thoroughly tested. By following TDD, you write tests before developing features, ensuring each component functions correctly before moving on. This methodology not only improves code quality but also enhances future maintenance and scalability of the application.
