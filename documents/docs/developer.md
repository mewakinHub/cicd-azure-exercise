Dependency injection is a design pattern widely used in software development to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. Through this pattern, the dependencies of a class (such as objects, settings, or services) are supplied externally rather than hard-coded within the class. This technique helps in reducing coupling between components, making the system easier to manage and scale.

### Key Concepts of Dependency Injection

1. **Dependencies**: These are objects or components that a class needs to perform its function. For instance, if you have a class that accesses a database, the database connection is a dependency.

2. **Injector**: The role of an injector is to create the instances of dependencies and supply them to the class that requires them. This can be done manually in the code or using a framework that supports dependency injection.

3. **Containers**: In many frameworks, especially in complex applications, a container is used to manage dependencies. The container automatically takes care of providing the required dependencies when creating instances of a class.

### Benefits of Dependency Injection

- **Testing**: Easier testing is a major benefit. By injecting dependencies, it becomes straightforward to replace them with mocks or stubs during testing.
- **Flexibility and Reusability**: Components can be easily replaced or reused since they are decoupled from their dependencies.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to dependencies or their configurations can be managed in one place without modifying the classes that use them.

### Examples of Dependency Injection

```python
@router.post("/stock-data", response_model=StockResponse)
async def stock_data_endpoint(
    stock_request: StockRequest, 
    fetcher: StockDataFetcher = Depends()
):
    try:
        service = StockService(fetcher=fetcher)
        return await service.get_indicator_data(stock_request)
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

In this example, `StockService` requires an instance of `StockDataFetcher`. Instead of creating a `StockDataFetcher` directly inside the `stock_data_endpoint` function, FastAPI's `Depends()` function is used to inject it. This separation allows you to:
- Easily replace `StockDataFetcher` with a mock or fake version for testing.
- Configure or modify `StockDataFetcher` independently of `StockService`, adhering to the single-responsibility and open-closed SOLID principles.

### Using Dependency Injection in Various Frameworks

Dependency Injection is supported in many modern programming frameworks and environments:
- **Spring** (Java): Provides extensive DI capabilities for managing beans and dependencies.
- **ASP.NET Core** (C#): Uses built-in dependency injection for controllers, services, and other components.
- **Angular** (TypeScript/JavaScript): Manages services and components with hierarchical injectors.

This pattern is crucial for building scalable, maintainable, and testable applications, making it a fundamental aspect of modern software architecture.
