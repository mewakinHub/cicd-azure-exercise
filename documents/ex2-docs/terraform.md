# Using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code

## Overview
This document outlines the use of Terraform to manage infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as part of a CI/CD pipeline for machine learning models.

## Terraform Basics
- **Purpose**: Terraform allows you to define and create complete infrastructure as code, which includes everything from networks to compute instances to storage services.
- **Providers**: Terraform relies on plugins called providers to interact with cloud services like GCP.

## Configuration Example
Here is a basic Terraform configuration for creating a storage bucket on GCP:
```hcl
provider "google" {
  credentials = file("<CREDENTIALS_FILE>")
  project     = "<PROJECT_ID>"
  region      = "us-central1"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket" "ml_model_storage" {
  name     = "ml-model-storage-${random_id.id.hex}"
  location = "US"
}
```

## Benefits
- **Consistency**: Terraform ensures that the infrastructure is provisioned in an exact and predictable manner, reducing discrepancies between environments.
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes are versioned along with code, allowing for easy tracking and rollbacks if needed.

## Conclusion
Leveraging Terraform within CI/CD pipelines enhances the robustness and scalability of machine learning deployments, streamlining the management of necessary cloud resources.
